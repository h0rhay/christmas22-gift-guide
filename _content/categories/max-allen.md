desc: "If London was a flavour, it would taste a lot like Max Allen’s creations. The designer’s punk spirit epitomises everything that’s cool about the capital – from fabulous outfits to fierce creativity. He’s also responsible for the imaginative outfits worn by our Christmas characters, who will roam the Selfridges stores with Santa throughout November and December. Channelling the OTT spirit of the festive season, we asked Max to share his recipe for a DIY papier-mâché decoupage decoration."
