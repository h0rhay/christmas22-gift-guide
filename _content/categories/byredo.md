title: "LAILA GOHAR’S RECIPE FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL CHRISTMAS"
subtitle:
type: "Gifts"
theme: "hero"
desc: "Chef Laila Gohar’s recipes aren’t like anyone else’s. Past dishes have included gigantic towers of langoustines, fish-shaped Champagne jellies with roses inside, metre-long jambon beurre baguettes and sculptures made entirely from butter. Hardly surprising, then, that she also does Christmas her own way. Together, Ben Gorham, Founder & Creative Director of Byredo, and Laila have created ‘One Another’, a playful offering of gift sets, tablecloths, napkins and curiosities destined for any holiday table. Here, Laila tells us about how she cooks up a festive celebration."

        description: “Everyone has their own take on what the season means; some traditional, others entirely made-up. That was where Laila and I found common ground,” describes Ben, “eschewing the hallmark ideas around ‘how to celebrate’ the holidays and instead zooming in on the human connection.”

        description: “I grew up in Egypt and our community was pretty eclectic, with people of different religions and ethnicities. Instead of traditional holidays, my family had a custom of celebrating something seemingly mundane and turning it into an occasion. I carry on with these ‘made-up holidays’ today.”
