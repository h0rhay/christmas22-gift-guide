desc: "The creators of New York-based food collective Ghetto Gastro – Lester Walker, Jon Gray and Pierre Serrao – are on a mission to nourish the world. Success for them is bringing together the cooking traditions of Black, Brown and Asian people and creating food experiences around the world. This takes shape in many forms, including recipes, events, merchandise and, most recently, their debut book, ‘Black Power Kitchen’. Evolving the concept of a conventional cookbook, the collective describes their new publication as ‘a manifesto’, uniting delicious recipes with family tributes, Black pop culture references and African-American history."
